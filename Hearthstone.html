<h2>History of hearthstone</h2>

<article>
  <li>Expansions are major card set additions to the game of Hearthstone. Expansions introduce large amounts of cards into the game, in contrast to adventures, with expansions featuring around 130-145 new cards and adventures only around 30-45 cards.
        Cards introduced into the game through expansions are referred to as expansion cards, and these are obtained chiefly through card packs, crafting, or Arena rewards.
        As of early 2017, the developers plan to release three expansions each year, each featuring around 130 new cards. Starting with Knights of the Frozen Throne, expansions will also feature optional solo-player content in the form of Missions, effectively integrating an adventure into each expansion.</li>
  <li>Next tables showcase all the expansions and adventures hearthstone received, starting with its first adventure, "Curse of naxxramas".</li>
